                            Typically, I don’t like to use the word “busy.” 
                            The word conjures up images of me rushing 
                            from meeting to meeting. Also, being 
                            “busy” makes me think about the times I tried 
                            to prove my worth by working way too many hours. 
                            Today, I try not to over-schedule or 
                            overwork myself. Lately, my schedule has 
                            been fuller than I’d like. I’m reflecting on 
                            ways to do less, so that I can make more space 
                            for the activities and people I love. As such, 
                            I’ve been thinking about how to be a good friend.

                            I love revisiting articles and books that inspire me; 
                            especially when I’m reflecting on how to be a 
                            better friend. For example, one of my favorite 
                            writers, Anne Helen Petersen, wrote a piece titled 
                            – <a href=""> You’d Be Happier Living Closer to 
                            Friends. Why Don’t You?</a>. In the article 
                            Petersen discussed why adults don’t live closer 
                            to their friends. Some of the reasons included 
                            not being socialized to prioritize friendship, 
                            friends who scattered across wide geographic 
                            areas, the housing market, job status, and more. 
                            Also, not prioritizing friendships can lead 
                            to <a href=""> loneliness.</a>

                            One of Petersen’s readers wrote about moving closer 
                            to friends in the comments section. <a href="">They said</a>, 
                            “… It’s hard to push back on the pressures of 
                            capitalism and definitions of success based on the 
                            nuclear family. I’m going to die someday, 
                            and I want to look back on my life and feel that 
                            I spent as much time as possible with the people I 
                            love, prioritizing joy and my personal 
                            values as much as possible. All of the constructed 
                            pressures around home ownership, wealth 
                            accumulation, job status — none of it inspires 
                            genuine peace or gratitude like being in 
                            community with the people who fill your heart. 
                            At least not for me. And so now I preach the 
                            good word — a meaningful social life over 
                            everything, if you can make it happen. 
                            (I know not everyone can.)”

                            This comment, and Petersen’s article, resonated 
                            with me. I’m not able to move closer to many of 
                            my friends. However, the authors reminded 
                            me that it is possible to be a good friend even 
                            when I’m busy (and far away). Below are 
                            some tips I use to have good friendships. I 
                            hope they help you too!

                                    Let your friends know what’s happening in 
                                    your life (both good and bad). Tell 
                                    them about your schedule, and let them know 
                                    when you have time to hang out. Being 
                                    honest about your time constraints is 
                                    important, and it’s just as important to 
                                    tell your friends that you love them 
                                    and want to stay connected. Communication 
                                    is important to the depth and quality 
                                    of friendships!

                                    There are many ways to keep in touch with friends. 
                                    Some ways to stay connected include 
                                    sending text messages, voice memos, letters, 
                                    sharing updates on social media, and 
                                    my favorite – phone calls. For example, if 
                                    you don’t have an hour to chat with a 
                                    friend on the phone, talk for 15 to 30 
                                    minutes. Focus on the quality – not 
                                    quantity – of your interactions. Even a short 
                                    phone call or a text message can strengthen 
                                    your relationships.

                                    The best way for me to stay connected 
                                    with friends is scheduling specific 
                                    times to hang out (either on the 
                                    phone or in-person). Also, I send 
                                    text messages and voice memos to 
                                    friends frequently. These commitments 
                                    are just as important as my job or 
                                    a doctor’s appointment.

                                    with your friends. For instance, I’ll

                                    Recently, one of my friends broke up with 
                                    their romantic partner. I tried to 
                                    show my support for them, even though 
                                    I couldn’t physically be there. I sent 
                                    encouraging text messages, listened 
                                    to their stories on the phone, 
                                    sent them uplifting postcards, and 
                                    more. If your friend is having a hard 
                                    time, show your support and let them know 
                                    you care. Small gestures of love are 
                                    powerful and are often all it takes to 
                                    be a good friend.

                                    I’m a fan of <a href=""> digital minimalism</a> and utilizing 
                                    technology. I’ve learned to use 
                                    technology with intention, and that has 
                                    made my friendships stronger. It’s also 
                                    made me happier. For example, I love using my 
                                    phone to stay in touch with friends. 
                                    Phone calls, text messages, and video calls 
                                    help me stay connected and updated 
                                    on what’s happening in my friends’ lives.

                                    Sometimes I can’t see my friends as much as 
                                    I’d like, so it’s important for me to 
                                    be flexible and loving when thinking about 
                                    how to be a good friend. For example, 
                                    friends have work commitments, kids, or 
                                    the responsibility of caring for aging 
                                    parents. Part of being a good friend means 
                                    that I need to be empathetic, understanding, 
                                    and flexible with their schedule.

                                    advance is fun! Plus, planning trips helps 
                                    me be intentional about how I want to spend my 
                                    time. I recently <a href="">visited San Diego</a> and I was 
                                    able to hang out with good friends and my 
                                    co-workers. The trip wouldn’t have 
                                    happened without planning, and we had a blast!

                            In an interview with Elena Renken author and 
                            friendship expert Lydia Denworth said, “Friendship 
                            is so familiar that we think we know all 
                            about it, but we don’t fully appreciate it. We 
                            think it’s pleasurable and fun, but friends are 
                            often the first thing to go when you’re busy. Or 
                            you fall in love and ditch your friends. I 
                            was guilty myself of passing a friend on the 
                            street corner here in Brooklyn and saying, ‘Let’s 
                            definitely get together,’ and then not. We are 
                            so achievement driven in so much of what we do. 
                            I think it’s healthy to be reminded that 
                            time with other people really matters.”
